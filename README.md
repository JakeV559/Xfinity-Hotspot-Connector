### Possible Improvements:
+ I'd be nice if another developer figured out how to switch connections without tcp connections getting reset. This seems like it      might   be possible since the ip-address often stays exactly the same between reconnects.

+ Support for mac & linux
+ Better display and network/bandwith chart
+ Other hotspot network support (e.g. at&t)
